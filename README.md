# Growth Mindest Def:

1-What is growth mindset ❓

    “A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed,” (Dweck, 2014).
2-What does it mean to have a growth mindset ❓

      When someone has a growth mindset they believe that they can continue to learn and become more intelligent with effort.  In contrast, someone who has a fixed mindset believes that they are born with a certain amount of talent and intelligence and that cannot be improved no matter how much effort they put forth.

3-Why is having a growth mindset important as a student and professional ❓

    Having a growth mindset is something that employers are always looking for.  If you believe that you can learn and become more skilled and intelligent you will be a harder worker and you will excel in whatever you do.  As a student, you will be open to learning new things and new information will come easily to you. 
    
# the Differnce Between fixed Mindset vs Growth Mindset.

  * A growth mindset means that you believe your intelligence and talents can be developed over time. 
  
  * A fixed mindset means that you believe intelligence is fixed—so if you’re not good at something, you might believe you’ll never be good at it.
